CAUTION: This is a work in progress, do not use in dev enviroment.

Project is built using the MEA2N/MEAN2 stack. This project is a good angular2-seed.

## TODO
1. ~~Create upload logic in Angular2~~ Done, the form is submitted by leveraging XHR, all images are saved at `uploadsForlder/user._id` path so every user has it's own folder seperated by id.
2. ~~Reset user password via email using a token~~ Done, the app uses SendGrid, the free plan is good for starting up.
3. ~~Redirect user to the `MyForms` page after submitting the form (see #6 below)~~ Done, the user now is redirected to a new page with a table of his forms
4. ~~Add an upload progress bar.~~ Done, in local enviroments the speed is so high that you almost can't see the progress loading.
5. ~~Resize the image before storing to file system.~~ Done, see Prerequisites below in order to install `gm`, needs a little bit more tweaking
6. ~~Add a new menu link for a new page, `MyForms` in order to display user's submitted forms.~~ Done, link added on menu
7. ~~Better styling~~. Done, style is much nicer now.
8. ~~Right now, front end is capable of uploading only 1 file, I will later fix back end in order to support multiple files~~ Only one file for now
9. ~~Form deletion among the assosiated images from file system~~ Done, form is deleted among the file associated with it. User forms array is updated too.
10. Resize the image client-side in order to reduce bandwidth of the server.

# Angular 2 Form

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.24.

The goal of this project is to submit a form with one file upload and two text fields. The form is submitted to back end, the file is stored in the `uploadsFolder` and then the file path/url is stored in MongoDB among the two text fields. At the end, the form ID is assinged to the signed in user ID (via Ref) for later viewing all the form fields and file in the front end.

##Prerequisites
1. MongoDB installed and running (http://mongodb.org)
2. Node.js and NPM installed (http://nodejs.org)
3. [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) or [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) installed,
more info in [gm](https://github.com/aheckmann/gm) page on how to install depending your Operating System. If installing ImageMagick on Windows, please check "Install Legacy Utitities (e.g. convert") during installation otherwise node will report errors.

## Specs
1. User login/signup using JSON Web Token (jwt)
2. User password reset via email (nodemailer & SendGrid)
3. Toastr Notifications (& Error Handling)
4. Multipart form submission with image preview before upload (some of the upload logic is taken from primeng ui).
5. Storing images to file system
6. Storing image path to MongoDB among text fields
7. Triple check if image is actually a file by checking it's mime type in both back end and in front end (`gm` in back end checks if file is an image too by reading first bytes of the file, need to fix this to not allow form to be submitted at all)
8. Double check for the image size in both back end and front end, file limit now is 5.000.000 bytes (5MB)
9. Image resize server side using [GraphicsMagick](https://github.com/aheckmann/gm)
10. Form deletion among the file from filesystem, user forms array is updated too.

2. Run `npm install` in your command line 

## Building the Angular2 app
Run `ng build`

A new `dist` folder will be created with all files needed to run the Angular 2 app in front end.

If you want to make changes on the Angular2 app and auto-refresh the `dist` folder then run the following command in your terminal:
 `ng build --watch`

## Running the server
Run `npm start`
If you want to make changes on the Server and auto refresh the back end code then run: `nodemon npm start`. If you don't have nodemon installed, run `npm install nodemon -g`.

## Viewing the App
Open your favourite web browser and point to `http://localhost:3000`

Enjoy!
